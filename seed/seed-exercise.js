Be careful not to move or roll the bar from your midfoot. 3. Bring your shins forward to touch the barbell – again without moving or rolling it away from your midfoot. Freeze your hips in place – they are not allowed to move from here. 4. Squeeze your chest up to tighten all the muscles of your back. Don’t drop your hips while you squeeze your chest up. This crucial step sets your lumbar spine in normal anatomical extension. 5. Drag the barbell up your legs while maintaining lumbar extension.
